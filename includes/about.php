                    Gospel Music Ally, in collaboration with other
                    partners, is organizing this talent hunt to bridge the gap in raising awareness and support for the
                    teeming number of talented individuals who, sadly, often leave the gospel-based entertainment
                    industry due to lack of support and recognition of their God-given talents.

                    The categories in the Gospel Music Ally Talent Hunt include Rap, Poetry, Spoken Words, and
                    Vocalists. The Grand Prize of 1 million naira will be split between cash and recording deals,
                    including a music video to promote the winner. Additionally, there are prizes of 500,000 and 250,000
                    naira for the second and third places, respectively, along with amazing consolation prizes for other
                    contestants.

                    and receive the recognition and support they deserve. It's an opportunity for individuals to pursue
                    their passion for gospel music and express their creativity in various art forms.
